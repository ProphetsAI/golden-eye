## Recommendations

For best experience I recommend using [FiraCode Retina Font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) with a fontWeight of 450. [Inter Font Family](https://github.com/rsms/inter) also has support for Font Ligatures. The [Material Icon Theme by https://pkief.com](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme) supports many file endings and looks very nice. Use the SideBar on the right side! This is where it belongs as it prevents code fluttering on toggle (which stresses your eyes even more). Also you should get your [Keyboard reference sheets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_keyboard-reference-sheets) and adjust it to your needs. I hope these are some nice tipps for your productivity..

Thanks to [sarah.drasner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl), [RobbOwen](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) and [WesBos](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2) for creating very nice-looking themes, which however are not very eye-friendly in most cases and therefore not recommended for everyday use. You should instead use a Light theme if available. Your eyes will thank you!
